<h2 id="virus">virus</h2>
<p>computer code that can <b>replicate</b> itself by modifying other files or programs to insert code that is capable of further replication. </p>
<p><b>requires some type of user assistance</b></p>
<h3 id="viruses-phase">Viruses Phase</h3>
<ol>
<li>dormant phase</li>
<li>propagation phase</li>
<li>triggering phase<ol>
<li>The virus is activated to perform the function for which it was intended. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>execution phase</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="common-virus-type">Common Virus Type</h3>
<ol>
<li>Boot Sector Infectors<ul>
<li>Boot sector is the part of a disk used to bootstrap the system or mount a disk,inserts itself into the boot sector of a disk</li>
<li>Example:Brain Virus<ul>
<li>Moves disk interrupt vector (location 0x13) to location 0x6d and sets disk interrupt location to invoke Brain virus.</li>
<li>If value 0x1234 in word at location 0x4 of new disk, boot continues normally.  If not, disk is infected</li>
<li>Infection sometimes overwrite some sectors, thus the sometimes destructive nature of the Brain virus</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Executable Infectors<ul>
<li>Executable infector: virus that infects executable programs.Viruses prepends or appends itself to executable</li>
<li>Example: Jerusalem Virus(Oct 1,1987, one of the oldest viruses),considerably slowed down the machine. A person could identify the virus but noticing two lines on the monitor. <ul>
<li>if a Friday the 13th and year is not 1987, virus sets flag in memory to delete files instead of infecting them</li>
<li>In memory, virus checks all calls to DOS service interrupt, looking for files to be executed</li>
<li>Virus checks file name, and deletes file if destruct bit set (except for COMMAND.COM file)</li>
<li>Virus checks last five bytes of file.  <ul>
<li>If string MsDos, file is infected</li>
<li>If not, virus checks whether name of file ends in E or M, in which case virus infects it (assuming its a COM or EXE file)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example: CIH virus<ul>
<li>CIH and Chernobyl(1998,Taiwan)</li>
<li>Trigger: April 26th or the 26th of any month (depending on virus version)<ul>
<li>Overwrote data on the HDD of the infected PC</li>
<li>Overwrite the BIOS of the infected computer, thus preventing boot-up</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multipartite Viruses 多重感染病毒<ul>
<li>Virus that can infect either boot sectors or applications</li>
<li><b>Virus typically has two parts, one for each type.  </b></li>
<li><b>First Multipartite viruses: Ghostball,</b> by Fridrik Skulason,Oct 1989</li>
<li><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/7OJSHG2.jpg"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TSR Viruses Terminate and Stay Resident Viruses 终止常驻病毒<ul>
<li>stays active (resident) in memory after application (or bootstrapping or disk mounting) has terminated.</li>
<li>Example:<b>Barin, Jerusalem</b></li>
<li><b>Non TSR viruses execute only when host application is executed</b> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stealth Viruses 秘密病毒<ul>
<li>conceal the infection of files</li>
<li>Intercept calls to the OS that access files<ul>
<li>If call is for file attributes, original (uninfected) file attributes returned</li>
<li>If call is to read file, uninfected version is returned</li>
<li>If call is to execute file, infected file is executed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Encrypted Viruses 加密病毒<ul>
<li>Virus that enciphers all of the virus code except for a small decryption routine</li>
<li>Anti-virus software looks for known sequences of code,To fight this, some viruses encipher most of code, leaving only small decryption routine and random cryptographic key in clear</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Polymorphic Viruses 多态病毒<ul>
<li>A virus that changes  its form each time it inserts itself into another program</li>
<li>used to hide decryption code</li>
<li><b>Considered an encrypted virus</b></li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Macro Viruses 宏病毒</p>
<h2 id="-a-virus-that-it-composed-of-a-sequence-of-instructions-that-is-interpreted-rather-than-executed-directly">- A virus that it composed of a sequence of instructions that is interpreted rather than executed directly 用宏语言写的病毒</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/TlpZjf3.png">
- Example: Melissa Virus 影响Word97,98,VB语言书写,March 26,1999</p>
<pre><code>- If launched, the macro virus will attempt to start Microsoft Outlook to send copies of the infected document via email to up to 50 people in Outlook’s address book as an attachment. 
- copies itself into the Normal template so that any files that are opened are infected
- Then invokes mail program and sends copies to names in address book
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Example:The Love Bug<ul>
<li>The virus is circulating through email and affecting many customers. If run, the virus could overwrite .jpg, .mp3, and other file types, and attempt to send a copy of itself to everyone in the recipient's address book.</li>
<li>The e-mail containing the virus typically carries a subject line of "ILOVEYOU". Inside the mail is a short message saying "Kindly check the attached LOVELETTER coming from me" and an attachment named LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.txt.vbs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Panda Burning Incense Virus 熊猫烧香 Li Jun,2006,2007,China<ul>
<li>Once a computer was infected, the desktop icon of every executable file, such as Microsoft Corp.'s Word, would change into a picture of a panda holding three incense .</li>
<li>The virus spread through a variety of ways, and also has the game to steal user account, QQ accounts and other functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>detection</li>
<li>identification</li>
<li>removal </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="anti-virus-evolution">Anti-Virus Evolution</h3>
<h4 id="first-generation-signature-scanner">first-generation <b>Signature scanner</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>scanner requires a virus signature to identify a virus. </li>
<li>The virus may contain "wildcards" but has essentially the same structure and bit pattern in all copies. </li>
<li>Such signature-specific scanners are limited to the detection of known viruses. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="second-generation-heuristics">second-generation heuristics</h4>
<ul>
<li>scanner uses heuristic rules to search for probable virus infection, e.g to look for fragments of code that are often associated with viruses.. </li>
<li>Another second-generation approach is integrity checking, using a hash function rather than a simpler checksum.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="third-generation-identify-actions">Third-generation Identify Actions</h4>
<ul>
<li>programs are memory-resident programs that identify a virus by its actions rather than structure in an infected program. </li>
<li>These have the advantage that it is not necessary to develop signatures / heuristics, but only to<b> identify the small set of actions indicating an infection is attempted and then intervene.</b></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fourth-generation-combination-package">Fourth-generation combination package</h4>
<ul>
<li>packages consisting of a variety of antivirus techniques used in conjunction. </li>
<li>These include scanning and activity trap components. </li>
<li>In addition, such a package includes access control capability, which limits the ability of viruses to penetrate a system and then limits the ability of a virus to update files in order to pass on the infection.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trojan">Trojan</h2>
<p>a malware program that appears to perform some useful task, but which also does something with negative consequences </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Trojan horse <b>can be deliberately attached to otherwise useful software</b> by a cracker</p>
</li>
<li>or it can be spread by tricking users into believing that it is a useful program</li>
<li><b>Trojans currently have largest infection potential</b></li>
