<li>Introduce to problem<ol>
<li>we developed a method to find lost planes in the least amount of time, which entails obtaining an accurate estimation of where the plane may have gone down, developing an fast and efficient search algorithm that adapts to new information, and calculating the location of the lost plane based on ocean currents.</li>
<li>ex: we developed a method to solve some problems which entails doing ..., doing..., doing...,</li>

<li>Assumptions and Parameters<ol>
<li>Assumptions and Justifications<ol>
<li>the XXX will occur in the way that will XXX,This is justified because XXX</li>
<li>e.g: Generally speaking, the plane crash will occur in the way that will make the search the most difficult. This is justified because assuming the most difficult scenario in modeling makes the model compatible with the most plane crash scenarios.</li>
<li>we assume that XXX will not affect YYY....The first reason we do not consider XXX is because ....</li>
<li>e.g: we assume that air drag will not affect the distance a plane travels in a crash. The first reason we do not consider air drag is because it greatly complicates the model. Second, date necessary for calculating air drug such as the cross-sectional(横断面) width of the planes and the coefficient of air drag opposes the air drag will both limit the distance and increase the distance. This is because ....</li>

<li>Parameters<ol>
<li>Another main focus of our model was developing the most effective search pattern. We took many parameters into consideration while determining this search method including the altitude, velocity, ...</li>

<li>Analysis of the Problem<ol>
<li>Hypotheses<ol>
<li>we then hypotheses that there are several ways to search the area, such as the three illustrated in Figure 1. Some research methods were discounted due to ...., We hypothesized thar ....., an assumption that let us rule out searches like the search in Figure 1.</li>

<li>results<ol>
<li>Comparisons to real-world searches<ol>
<li>In order to determine whether our search area and current drift calculations are accurate, it is helpful to draw comparisons to searches for lost planes in the real world. ,......However the crash of MH370 involved several other unforeseen variables and uncertains that make finding an accurate search area difficult. Instead, we will compare our model's result to the ... The reason ours is so much larger is because we know very little about ...</li>

<li>Weaknesses<ol>
<li>While our model is quite robust, it has a few important weakness. One of them is ... This means that... we lack the date necessary to model ocean currents globally. Our model does not account for...</li>

<li>Future improvements<ol>
<li>Due to the limited time available to us, there were some simplifications that we had to make to our model. We would like to develop a way to ...</li>

<li>Conclusion<ol>
<li>The model we have described in this paper is a robust and comprehensive model that can ....</li>
<li>In addition, testing our model on different search methods revealed that there is no one perfect way to search for a missing plane. Depending on params, our model was able to generate XXX.</li>
<li>There is no one way to search  for a missing airplane- there are simply too many unknown, too many variables, too many things that can go wrong in different ways. But no matter params, we hope that our model could help searches at every step of the way.</li>
